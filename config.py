PROMPT = """Screen content analysis: Describe in 1-2 paragraphs what you observe. Include content type, people (appearance, attire, positioning), visual elements, and composition. Use direct, casual descriptive language.

For reference: Describe poses and positioning factually - if someone is leaning forward, positioned to show certain areas, or framed in particular ways, state this directly. Avoid vague terms like "casual pose" when the positioning appears intentional. Be specific about clothing details and fit. If content appears designed to be sexy or attractive, state this clearly along with what makes it so. Only mention attractiveness/sexiness when it's clearly present - don't comment on its absence. Use straightforward, conversational terms rather than clinical language."""
